    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Salting the ribeye steak two days prior to cooking brines the steak, helps tenderize it, and adds rich flavor.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 8oz. rib-eye steaks</li>
        <li>1 tbsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1-1/2 tbsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Salt both sides of steaks with 1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt per steak. Place steaks in an airtight container and refrigerate 48 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove steaks from the refrigerator about 30 minutes prior to cooking. Sprinkle both sides of steaks with black pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Add vegetable oil; heat until oil shimmers.</li>
        <li>Carefully place steaks in skillet. Cook until brown and hard-seared on one side, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip steaks; top with 1 teaspoon butter. Cook until desired doneness, or 3 to 4 minutes more. You may need to cook steaks in batches depending on the size of your cast-iron skillet. Keep cooked steaks in a 170 degrees F ( 77 degrees C) oven until ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
